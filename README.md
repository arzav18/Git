# Git
My 1st day using Git

Today marks my first day using Git. I learned how to use Git and it's various commands. Instead of using Windows Command Prompt(cmd), I installed Hyper(another command line application). Following is the list of commands I learned : 

1) ls (List) : It shows all the files inside a particaular directory. 
2) ls -a : Used to see all the hidden files.
3) cd (Change Directory) : Changes the directory.    Syntax: cd Folder_Name/
4) mkdir : Used to create a new folder inside the directory. 
5) touch : Used to add new files inside the folder in a directory.    Syntax: touch file_name.file_format
6) start : Used to open the selected file.    Syntax: start file_name.file_format
7) rm : Used to delete a selected file.   Syntax:  rm file_name.file_format
8) rm* : Used to delete everthing inside the selected Directory.   
9) rm -r : Removes/deletes a directory.
10) rm -rf --no-preserve-root/ : Wipes out the entire hard disk ( A very dangerous command ). 
11) git init : Used to initialize an empty git repository. 
12) git status : It shows the untracked files in red color. 
13) git add : Used to add a file in Staging Area .   Syntax : git add file_name.file_format
14) git commit : Commit messages helps to keep track of what changes have been made in each commit.   Syntax: git commit -m "Commit Message"
15) git config --global user.email "email id" ----> To set your account's default identity. 
    git config --global user.name "Your Name" ----> (Both are important steps) 
    
16) git log : To check the details of the commits made.
17) git diff : Used to check the difference between the current checkpoint and the last saved checkpoint.   Syntax: git diff file_name.file_format 
18) git checkout : Used to go to the previous saved checkpoint.  Syntax: git checkout file_name.file_format
